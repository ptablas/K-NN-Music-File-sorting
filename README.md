# K-NN-Music-File-sorting
MATLAB's program is capable of sorting music files between two genres (in this case between Japanoise and Japanese Free Jazz) using the K-nearest neighbor algorithm.

## Analysis parameters

Three parameters were found to give meaningful and distinguished information between the genres, namely:

- Roughness Mean: Mean of perceptual dissonance, related to the closeness of frequency peaks around frequency bands found in the human auditory system.
- Skewness: Simmetry of Distribution, roughly detecting repetition.
- Root Mean Square: Global energy of the data.
